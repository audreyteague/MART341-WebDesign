        Both of my dogs are cattle dog mixes. They both have so much energy that 
        we have to exercise them approprietyly or else they get anxious and distructive.

        To work with their innate nature, my fiance and I began hiking and exploring with both
        dogs at very young ages. As well as working on certain recalls, we are now confident hiking
        duos that allow for them to safely release their energy and continue building our bonds to 
        our dogs.
