            <img src="./Images/90sBB.jpg" height="200" width="200">
            <p>Like most kids, I wanted to hang around my older sister all of the time. I followed her around
                I tried to become apart of her friend group and I lost most control privaledges. The good old
                saying of "with age comes privaledge. However, due to these curcumstances, I was exposed to the 
                same cartoons as said sister. This means that the foundational cartoons like scooby do, pinky and the 
                brain, looney tunes, spongebob, rugrats, dexters laboratory, you get the idea; were the pillars of 
                my development and character arc. Nerdy I know, but these were crucial in cultural milestones in 90's babies
                that was continued onto me.

            <h2 id="everything-else">Second Argument</h2>
            <img src="./Images/Music.jpg" height="200" width="200">
            <p>Music was another pivotal aspect to 90's baby identity. My family was always extremely into music from
                as long as I can rememeber. From listening to Johnny Cash on the way to school or the newest hits on MTV.
                I think the transition from 90's to 00's music was appreciated by those of the 90's, but that could be the later
                half of the 90's group as that was my sister's half. Because of my extensive knowledge and love for this Music
                is another great argument for my case.

        <div class="second-container">
            <h2 id="everything-else">Third Argument</h2>
            <img src="./Images/BobbyJack.jpg" height="200" width="200">
            <p>My final argument is the fashion of the early 00's. As I mentioned, my sister was a later 90's baby but none the less, a 90's baby.
                I remember the twinning phase and wanting to dress like my older sister and the world of Bobby Jack and Justice were on the rise. 
                The great monkey themed shirts and overly colorful and patterned bermuda shorts stocked my closet. The age of 
                knee high converse were also trending but because I was younger and my feet were growing I had socks that mimiced
                these shoes. I would wear that with the justice outfit. I think it's safe to say I was under the same trance as the aging 90's crowd.
